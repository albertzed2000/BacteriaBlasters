A bullet-hell/heaven game that exercises sprite animation and simple moving particles in SimpleGUI for Python2 Codeskulptor

**Introduction:**
This game used to be fully functioning with a smooth continuous scrolling background and beautiful animated character sprites.
This all changed when the fire nation attacked, destroying the structural integrity of the code and replacing everything with very bad
pictures of the now-deceased Hip-Hop performer, Jahseh Dwayne Ricardo Onfroy, known professionally as XXXTentacion. Although this decreased
the overall game quality, I decided to keep this unique feature in honour of XXXTentacion's work as an inspiration to millions of fans
worldwide. I can personally attest that his influence in music was one of a unique stature, alluring Hip-hop fans and somehow allowing
them to forget their struggles in mental health and depression. After his passing, thousands of fans mourned the loss, as his music
got many through their toughest times. Although many argue that his alleged sexual assault is inexcusable, I personally believe that
all humans are flawed, and that we can attribute his mistakes to his constant mental instability that he'd made a great effort to treat
throughout his life. I tribute this terrible game to the devasting robbery and murder of Onfroy.


**Technical Description:**
Entire game programmed by me for fun. SimpleGUI extension in Codeskulptor used for everything GUI. No advanced recursion, clean software
design, design principles, or sorting algorithms implemented here.
